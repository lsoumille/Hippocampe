description : The Feodo Tracker Feodo IP Blocklist contains IP addresses (IPv4) used as C&C communication channel by the Feodo Trojan. This lists contains two types of IP address: Feodo C&C servers used by version A, version C and version D of the Feodo Trojan (these IP addresses are usually compromised servers running an nginx daemon on port 8080 TCP or 7779 TCP that is acting as proxy, forwarding all traffic to a tier 2 proxy node) and Feodo C&C servers used by version B which are usually used for the exclusive purpose of hosting a Feodo C&C server.
